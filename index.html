      <p>Probably many of you have heard about the sourdough.
        If you are here because you want to know more about how the sourdough bread is made it's perfectly fine,
        we will tell you what lies behind the word <em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sourdough"
            target="_blank" style="color:black">sourdough</a></em>.
        Or are you short on time and just want to pick your favorite type of bread or bakery product, that is fine
        too.
        Click on it and have it in a couple of hours on your table, you are also at the perfect place.
        <br>Sourdough is a bread made from the natural occurring yeast and bacteria
        in flour. In traditional sourdough recipes, you’ll find three ingredients:
      <ul>
        <li>sourdough starter (which consists of flour and water)</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li> and flour</li>
      </ul>
      These three ingredients are enough to prepare a tasty and traditional bread. There is no yeast, no milk, no oils
      and no sweeteners.
      It’s about as natural as you get when it comes to bread.<br>
      In addition to having a very distinctive and delicious taste, sourdough bread has a lot of helath benefits. Fist
      of all supports gut health.
      The fermentation process and higher fibre content makes sourdough a useful option for those with blood sugar
      management issues, furthermore
      offer additional benefits against developing heart diseas. Not at least it appears to be more nutritious owing
      to
      the long tofermentation process
      which helps phytic acid to break down enabling us to access the grain's nutrients more readily.
